Linked Conservation Data Example

In 2007 the [Raphael Research Resource](https://cima.ng-london.org.uk/documentation/) project began to examine how complex conservation, scientific and art historical research could be combined in a flexible digital form. Exploring the presentation of interrelated high resolution images and text, along with how the data could be stored in relation to an event driven ontology in the form of RDF triples. In addition to the main user interface the data stored within the system is now also accessible in the the form of open linkable data combined with a SPARQL end-point at https://rdf.ng-london.org.uk/rrr/sparql.

These web-pages where put together, initially in 2011, as an example of how this SPARQL end-point can be used. In 2019 they where updated to work with [Blazegraph](https://www.blazegraph.com/).

A live example of these pages can be found [here](https://rdf.ng-london.org.uk/workshops/lcd/).
